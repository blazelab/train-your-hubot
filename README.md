## Install 

1. git clone https://github.com/saraford/train-your-hubot.git
2. npm install
3. copy the hubot-sample folder from https://github.com/saraford/hubot-electron-adapter into the train-your-hubot/node-modules folder. It's next on my todo list to have this as a npm install to avoid this step.
4. npm start

## Note
train-your-hubot will create a myHubotScripts folder in your Documents directory.
